Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

I will be selecting files to download from the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. source, as described in the following instructions. I have chosen all of 2022 CitiBike data as downloaded and put in my Resources folder. Please note: The citibike22_data.csv created in jupyter notebook and referenced in Tableau is too large to be uploded by either csv or zip file. I have shown my instructor this file to verify it's existence!

The two phenomenons that I wanted to look at were the user type and time of day/month/weekday implications on riding.

I found that Season did increase the amount of casual riders, indicating that more people are either vacationing in the Jersey City area and that the weather will be nicer. Members rode less in the winter than any other season which is to be expected as commutimg to work in the cold months is not ideal. Surprisingly the only time the numbers were almost 50/50 was at the early morning 3AM and 4AM - most likely few who are coming home late.

The second phenomenon was lookinh at differenting Peaks. In 2022, the season that had the most amount of riders was the Summer. However, Fall and Spring also have significantly more riders than the Winter. No matter the season, peak riding says were the weekends, specifically Saturday. As to be expected with commuters, the peak riding times were 5PM-7PM  Monday through Friday. 

What I found interesting about the End Stations was that they included Stations in New York, implying tthat the data per trip applied to whatever state the rider was arriving to (the End Stations). This would be why there is a lack of New York stations in the Start Station Map. The top 10 end and start stations are all the same, implying most people are doing a round trip from home to work.
